This is a collection of known design patterns and some sample code how to implement them in PHP. Every pattern has a small list of examples (most of them from Zend Framework, Symfony2 or Doctrine2 as I’m most familiar with this software).

I think the problem with patterns is that often people do know them but don’t know when to apply which.
